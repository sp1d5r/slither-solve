## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the installation script:
   ```
   ./installation-script.sh
   ```
3. Set up your Firebase configuration

4. Start developing!

## Frontend

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, offering a modern and type-safe development experience. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and includes shadcn components for rapid UI prototyping and development.

## Backend

The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, written in TypeScript for improved maintainability and developer experience. It's pre-configured to work seamlessly with Firebase services.

## Authentication

Authentication is pre-setup and integrated with Firebase, providing a secure and scalable solution out of the box. All you need to do is add the environment secrets from firebase in the `.env` file in the frontend directory. 
* Then 

## Firebase Integration

This project comes with Firebase backend support, allowing you to leverage Firebase's powerful features such as real-time database, cloud functions, and more.

## Development

- To start the frontend development server: `cd frontend && npm start`
- To start the backend development server: `cd backend && npm run dev`
- To start both frontend and backend server in the main server: `npm start`
